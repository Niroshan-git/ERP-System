# PROGRESS.md — Smart Factory on ERPNext

Chronological record of what's actually been done. Update this as work progresses rather than relying on chat history.

## Architecture & Planning Decisions

- Evaluated free/open-source ERP options broadly; chose **ERPNext** (built on the Frappe framework) as the ERP core — GPL-3.0 licensed, no paywalled modules unlike Odoo Community Edition.
- Confirmed ERPNext/Frappe's license terms: GPL-3.0 allows commercial use, whitelabeling, and selling implementation/hosting services, but forbids relicensing the core as closed-source, and requires source availability to anyone the software is distributed to.
- Decided on the **headless architecture**: unmodified ERPNext/Frappe core + separate custom Frappe app (`smart_factory`) for business logic + independent frontend (Next.js/Vercel) talking only through the REST API. This keeps the proprietary layer (frontend + custom app + MES/IoT service) legally separate from the GPL core.
- Mapped out the full Smart Factory layered architecture: Shop floor/IoT → Integration & MES → ERPNext core → Analytics & digital twin.
- Wrote the full 12-week implementation plan (see `PLAN.md`), tracked in a Notion page titled "Smart Factory on ERPNext – Weekly Implementation Plan".

## Infrastructure — Hosting Attempts

- **Oracle Cloud (abandoned):** Created an Oracle Cloud Always Free account, home region ended up as Singapore (the originally intended region wasn't available at signup). Attempted to provision a `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` instance (2 OCPU / 12GB RAM — Oracle's current Always Free ARM allocation after a June 2026 reduction from the older 4 OCPU/24GB). Hit repeated "out of host capacity" errors across multiple retry attempts. Since the account's region only has a single Availability Domain (AD-1), there was no AD to switch to as a workaround. Decision made to stop retrying and move to a paid host instead.
- **Hetzner Cloud (current):** Created a Hetzner account. Provisioned a **CX23** server (2 vCPU / 4GB RAM / 40GB SSD, Regular Performance tier, x86, Ubuntu 26.04) in **Helsinki** — roughly €4.50–7/month depending on final config. Provisioned successfully on the first real attempt, no capacity issues. Server name: `ubuntu-4gb-hel1-4`. Public IP: `62.238.22.161`.

## Server Setup

- Generated an SSH key pair locally (Windows, `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`), added the public key to Hetzner during server creation.
- Confirmed SSH access works: `ssh -i <key path> root@62.238.22.161`.
- Ran `apt update && apt upgrade -y` — patched the OS, including a kernel upgrade (7.0.0-30 → 7.0.0-31-generic), followed by a reboot to load the new kernel.
- Installed Docker: `apt install docker.io docker-compose-v2 -y` — completed cleanly.

## ERPNext Deployment

- Cloned `frappe/frappe_docker` from GitHub.
- Deployed using the `pwd.yml` quick-start compose file: `docker compose -f pwd.yml up -d`. All 11 images pulled successfully, all 16 containers (db, redis-cache, redis-queue, backend, frontend, websocket, scheduler, queue-short, queue-long, create-site, configurator) started without errors.
- Confirmed the `create-site` container completed successfully — Frappe and ERPNext both installed, DocTypes updated to 100%, site set to `frontend`.
- Logged into ERPNext at `http://62.238.22.161:8080` with Administrator / the `pwd.yml` default password (`admin`) — **this default password still needs to be changed before any real client data touches this instance.**
- Completed the initial company setup wizard (placeholder company details for the pilot environment).

## Version Control

- Created a GitHub repository for the project's custom app code: **https://github.com/Niroshan-git/ERP-System.git**
- Discussed (not yet executed) the workflow for editing code: VS Code's Remote-SSH extension to connect to the Hetzner server, then the Dev Containers extension's "Attach to Running Container" to edit files live inside the `frappe_docker-backend-1` container, with regular `git commit`/`git push` to the GitHub repo above since the container's filesystem is otherwise disposable.
- Authenticated the `gh` CLI locally (browser device-code flow). Initialized git at the monorepo root (not inside a container — the monorepo itself, including `apps/frontend`, lives and is version-controlled from the local Windows checkout; the container-based workflow above still applies once `smart_factory` exists and needs live in-container editing).
- Merged in the remote's pre-existing initial commit (`--allow-unrelated-histories`) and pushed the full scaffold + Ceylon Stack rebrand as the first real commit.
- Removed the default **MIT LICENSE** file GitHub had auto-created — MIT doesn't fit a proprietary whitelabel product. No LICENSE file now means default all-rights-reserved until a real commercial license is drafted.

## apps/frontend — Scaffolded & Rebranded

- Scaffolded with `create-next-app` (TypeScript, Tailwind v4, App Router, `src/` dir, `@/*` import alias).
- Ceylon Stack design tokens (from `DESIGN.md` / `docs/brand.md`) wired into `src/app/globals.css` via Tailwind v4's `@theme inline`, both light and `prefers-color-scheme: dark` variants.
- Fonts (Fraunces, Archivo, IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Mono) loaded via `next/font/google` in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Logo/favicon assets copied from `docs/brand/` into `public/brand/`.
- Replaced the default starter homepage with a static, on-brand placeholder dashboard (KPI tiles, status pills, Job Card table) standing in for the real dashboard until ERPNext API integration starts.
- Verified with a clean `npm run build` and a working `npm run dev` (confirmed via `curl`, not a browser — no browser-automation tool available in this environment).

## ERPNext Desk Rebrand (Ceylon Stack) — settings-only pass

Following `DESIGN.md` §6's rollout order, steps done **without** creating the `smart_factory` app yet (that's intentionally deferred — see Decision Log):

- **Website Settings:** App Name → "Ceylon Stack", App Logo and Favicon uploaded from `docs/brand/` (via SSH + `bench --site frontend console`, since `frappe.utils.file_manager.save_file` + a direct doc save was the only way to script an image upload headlessly).
- **Navbar Settings:** App Logo set (was previously empty).
- **Dashboard Chart colors:** all 49 shipped chart records recolored from ERPNext's default/random palette to Ceylon Stack sapphire (default) with cinnamon on paired trend charts (Delivery Trends, Purchase Receipt Trends, Outgoing/Incoming Bills). These are standard/shipped records that reject normal `doc.save()` outside developer mode ("Cannot edit Standard charts") — updated via `frappe.db.set_value` instead.
- **Splash/loading screen logo:** the brief logo flash shown on a full Desk page refresh comes from `Website Settings.splash_image` (falls back to ERPNext's logo when unset — `erpnext/hooks.py`'s `splash_image` default, rendered by `templates/includes/splash_screen.html`). Was never set; pointed it at the same uploaded Ceylon Stack logo used for `app_logo`. Settings-only, no app needed.
- **Navbar bar color/style — confirmed needs `smart_factory`:** checked `Navbar Settings` doctype fields directly — it only exposes `app_logo` and dropdown content, no background-color field. The navbar's color comes from compiled core CSS, so matching `DESIGN.md`'s navbar spec needs `app_include_css`, same category as the sidebar "ERPNext" label. User has now been asked about creating `smart_factory` twice (once for the sidebar label, once implicitly for the navbar) and both times chose to keep deferring it.
- **Administrator display name:** renamed the `Administrator` user's `first_name` to "Ceylon Stack" (found `full_name` is derived from `first_name`/`last_name`, not directly settable) — the account widget, "Created by" fields, comments, etc. now show "Ceylon Stack" instead of "Administrator". Login email (`admin@example.com`) intentionally left unchanged — that's tied to the still-pending default-password change, not branding.
- **Known gap — confirmed needs `smart_factory`, not settings-only:** the "ERPNext" text shown under a workspace title in the sidebar (e.g. "Selling" workspace → "ERPNext" beneath it) is the app-switcher label. Traced it to `erpnext/hooks.py`'s `app_title = "ERPNext"` (and `frappe/hooks.py`'s `app_title = "Frappe Framework"`), assembled server-side into boot data via the `add_to_apps_screen` hook (`frappe/boot.py:182`) — it's the installed app's own identity metadata, not a document/settings field, so no settings-only trick reaches it. The only non-core fix is a custom app's `boot_session` (or equivalent) hook rewriting that label client-side. User was asked whether to create `smart_factory` now for this specifically and **chose to keep deferring it** — this remains the one open item that genuinely requires the app; see Decision Log. Workspace icon background color (fixed named-color dropdown, no arbitrary hex) is a smaller version of the same limitation.

## `smart_factory` app created — full Desk branding pass (2026-09-12)

After being asked three times to fix the sidebar/app-switcher "ERPNext" text and confirming each time it needed a custom app, the user explicitly approved creating `smart_factory` now, scoped to the full client-visible branding pass (navbar, sidebar, splash, buttons/links, app-switcher label).

- **Created via `bench new-app smart_factory`** inside `frappe_docker-backend-1`, installed on the `frontend` site (`bench --site frontend install-app smart_factory`). App metadata: publisher "Ceylon Stack", email `niroshan4220@gmail.com`, license manually changed from the scaffolded `mit` to `Proprietary` in both `pyproject.toml` and `hooks.py` (the `bench new-app` license prompt only offers GitHub's OSI license list — there's no "proprietary" choice, so it's scaffolded as MIT and corrected after in our own app's files, not core).
- **`boot_session` hook** (`smart_factory/boot.py`): rewrites `bootinfo.app_data` on every session boot so `frappe`/`erpnext`/`smart_factory` all report `app_title = "CeylonStack"` and the Ceylon Stack logo. This is what `frappe/public/js/frappe/ui/sidebar/sidebar.js` reads into `header_subtitle` — confirmed via `bench console` simulation that bootinfo now returns "CeylonStack" for every app entry. This was the one thing no settings-only change could ever reach.
- **`app_include_css`** (`smart_factory/public/css/ceylon_stack_desk.css`): overrides Frappe's Desk CSS variables — `--primary`/`--brand-color` (buttons, links, progress bars, filter icons), `--navbar-bg` (navbar background → sapphire), `--surface-menu-bar`/`--sidebar-hover-color`/`--sidebar-active-color`/`--sidebar-border-color` (sidebar), plus light/dark variants matching `DESIGN.md` tokens.
- **`app_include_js`** (`smart_factory/public/js/ceylon_stack_desk.js`): a small MutationObserver safety net that relabels any leftover "ERPNext"/"Frappe Framework" text in `.header-subtitle` elements — belt-and-suspenders on top of the `boot_session` fix, in case of stale client state.
- **Known limitation, not yet addressed:** login page and print-format/letterhead colors weren't included in this pass — only the authenticated Desk chrome (navbar, sidebar, app-switcher). Revisit if/when clients will see the login page or invoices/quotations directly.

### Infrastructure gotcha discovered (important — read before touching `smart_factory` again)

`pwd.yml`'s quick-start setup runs `frappe/erpnext` as a **stock, unmodified image** — it was never designed for live-installing a custom app with static assets:

1. **The `frontend` (nginx) container is a completely separate filesystem from `backend`.** They share the `sites` docker volume, but `sites/assets` is itself a symlink to `/home/frappe/frappe-bench/assets`, which lives *outside* that shared volume, baked into each container's own image/writable layer. Creating `smart_factory` inside `backend` only put it in `backend`'s filesystem — `frontend` had no idea it existed, so it 404'd on `/assets/smart_factory/...`. **Fix applied:** `docker cp`'d `apps/smart_factory` from `backend` into `frontend`, then manually created the matching `assets/smart_factory` symlink inside `frontend` (normally created by `bench build`, which only ran on `backend`).
   - **This will not survive `frontend` being recreated** (image pull, `docker compose up --force-recreate`, etc. — a plain `restart` is fine, `rm`+recreate is not). If Desk CSS/JS suddenly reverts to default styling after any frontend container recreation, this is why — the `docker cp` + manual symlink step needs to be redone. The durable fix is building a custom Docker image with `smart_factory` baked in via `frappe_docker`'s documented custom-app build process, which is out of scope for now but should happen before this goes anywhere near real client traffic.
2. **Already-running gunicorn workers don't pick up a newly `pip install -e`'d app.** Editable-install path entries (`.pth` files) are only read by Python's `site` module at interpreter startup, not rescanned live. Installing `smart_factory` while `backend`/`queue-short`/`queue-long`/`scheduler`/`websocket` were already running broke **every single web request site-wide** (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'smart_factory'`, since Frappe imports every installed app's hooks module per-request) until those containers were restarted. **Fix applied:** `docker compose -f pwd.yml restart backend queue-short queue-long scheduler websocket` immediately after installing any new app. **Any future custom app install/creation on this server must end with that same restart, or the site goes down.**

## Workspace-switcher icon grid cleanup (2026-09-12)

The dropdown chevron next to the workspace name (top-left of the sidebar) opens a tile grid backed by a real `Desktop Icon` doctype — a separate, persisted data source from `bootinfo.app_data` (which the `smart_factory` `boot_session` hook already rebrands). Investigated because the user's screenshot showed duplicate "Framework"/"Frappe Framework" tiles, an unbranded "ERPNext Settings" tile, and several truncated labels ("Frappe Fra...", "Manufactur...", "Subcontrac...").

- **Duplicate app icon (pre-existing ERPNext quirk, not caused by us):** two `Desktop Icon` records represent the frappe app itself — `Framework` (`standard=1`, a shipped fixture from before frappe's `app_title` was renamed to "Frappe Framework") and `Frappe Framework` (`standard=0`, auto-created later; the de-dupe check in `create_desktop_icons_from_installed_apps()` only matches by exact name, so the rename left both). Hid the redundant `Frappe Framework` record (`hidden=1` via `frappe.db.set_value`).
- **Rebranded the remaining one:** `Framework` record's `label` → "CeylonStack", `logo_url` → the Ceylon Stack logo. The already-hidden `ERPNext` app icon (`hidden=1` since it ships that way — ERPNext's own workspaces show flat instead of nested under it) was left as-is since it's invisible.
- **Dropped "ERPNext" from Settings:** `ERPNext Settings` record's `label` → "Settings" (docname/internal key unchanged, only the displayed label).
- **Truncated labels:** added a CSS rule to `ceylon_stack_desk.css` targeting `.desktop-icon .icon-title` (the actual tile caption class, confirmed by cross-referencing `frappe/public/js/frappe/ui/desktop_icon.html` against the real `Desktop Icon` record labels) to let captions wrap onto two lines instead of ellipsis-truncating.
- All changes are `frappe.db.set_value` writes on `Desktop Icon` records (same core-guard-bypass technique as the Dashboard Chart color pass) plus one additive CSS rule — no core files touched, no new infrastructure. Redeployed the updated CSS to both `backend` and `frontend` containers per the established `docker cp` pattern (frontend needed `-u root` since the file is owned by root from the earlier copy).
- Verified via a fresh `get_bootinfo()` simulation: `Framework` → label "CeylonStack" hidden=0, `Frappe Framework` → hidden=1, confirming the fix is live.

## Smart Factory workspace + app-switcher tile (2026-09-12)

User noticed `smart_factory` had no presence in the app-switcher grid — expected, since the app so far only carries branding hooks (`boot_session`, `app_include_css/js`), no `Workspace` or `Desktop Icon` of its own. Module tiles (Manufacturing, Selling, Stock, etc.) turned out to be two separate, manually-paired records — creating a `Workspace` alone does **not** auto-generate a matching `Desktop Icon`; confirmed by inspecting `Manufacturing`'s `Desktop Icon` record (`icon_type=Link`, `link_type=Workspace Sidebar`, `link_to=Manufacturing`, `icon=organization`) side-by-side with the `Manufacturing` `Workspace` doc.

- Created a `Workspace` named "Smart Factory" (`module=Smart Factory`, `public=1`, `icon=manufacturing` — reused `erpnext`'s bundled `manufacturing.svg` since the app has no icon assets of its own yet) with a minimal placeholder header/paragraph block as content (no real dashboards yet — content is genuinely empty pending actual OEE/manufacturing features).
- Created the matching `Desktop Icon` record (`label=Smart Factory`, same `icon_type`/`link_type`/`icon` pattern as Manufacturing's, `app=smart_factory`, `link_to=Smart Factory`, `hidden=0`). Normal `.insert()` hit a `LinkValidationError` on `link_to` (Frappe's generic link-field validator doesn't recognize `link_type="Workspace Sidebar"` as resolving to the `Workspace` doctype even though the runtime desktop-icon renderer does) — inserted with `ignore_links=True` to bypass just that check; every other value went through normal validation.
- Cleared `desktop_icons` cache key and ran `bench --site frontend clear-cache`. No CSS/JS/container redeploy needed — this was pure data, not a code change.
- Verified the records directly (`hidden=0`, `link_to=Smart Factory` matching the workspace name, workspace `public=1`/`is_hidden=0`) since a full `load_desktop_data()` boot simulation needs more scaffolding than a one-off console script — direct record inspection was sufficient given both halves (icon + workspace) are confirmed correctly linked.
- Tile currently opens to a near-empty workspace — that's expected and correct for now; it's the landing spot future Manufacturing/OEE dashboard content (per `PLAN.md`) will populate, not a bug.

## Server Incident — 2026-09-12 reboot

- Rebooted the Hetzner Ubuntu server (`reboot`, no maintenance work needed it — routine). `pwd.yml` has **no `restart:` policy** on any service, so containers don't auto-start on boot; had to manually run `docker compose -f pwd.yml up -d` afterward.
- `frontend` and `websocket` containers briefly crash-looped after `up -d` (nginx: `host not found in upstream "backend:8000"`; websocket: `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN redis-queue`) — a boot-order race where they started before `backend`/`redis-queue` were ready. Fixed with `docker compose -f pwd.yml restart frontend websocket` once the rest of the stack was healthy. All 8 containers confirmed up afterward; site verified serving (HTTP 200) with branding intact.
- **Follow-up not yet done:** add `restart: unless-stopped` to `pwd.yml` services so this doesn't require a manual fix on every future reboot.

## Not Yet Done (see PLAN.md for full context)

- `smart_factory` exists and does the full Desk branding pass (navbar/sidebar/app-switcher/buttons); it does not yet contain any actual Manufacturing/OEE business logic — that's still 100% ahead, per `PLAN.md`.
- Login page and print-format/letterhead colors are still default ERPNext styling — the `smart_factory` branding pass only covered the authenticated Desk chrome.
- `smart_factory`'s presence on `frontend` (nginx) is a manual `docker cp` + symlink, not baked into an image — it will disappear if that container is ever recreated rather than just restarted. Needs a real custom Docker image build before this is production-safe (see the gotcha note above).
- No manufacturing master data (Items, BOM, Workstations, Work Orders) has been created yet.
- No mobile browser testing of the Desk UI has been done yet.
- ERPNext Administrator default password has not been changed yet.
- MQTT broker, MES/FastAPI service, Postgres/TimescaleDB have not been started. The Next.js frontend is scaffolded and branded but has no ERPNext API integration or real dashboard screens yet.
- `pwd.yml` has no `restart:` policy — containers require a manual restart after any server reboot.

## Decision Log

- **2026-09-12 — Committed to active build, target client/marketing push next month (Oct 2026):** Reviewed `ACCESS.md` (server/repo/command reference) — confirmed accurate, no real secrets stored in it. Rebranded the product as **Ceylon Stack** (brand identity, palette, and typography documented in `docs/brand.md`). Scaffolded the monorepo structure (`apps/smart_factory`, `apps/mcp-server`, `apps/mes-service`, `apps/frontend`, `infra/`, `docs/`) ahead of actually building each service. Repo will move to a separate GitHub account (not yet finalized) before the current `Niroshan-git/ERP-System` remote is treated as permanent.
- **Task tracking going forward:** the Notion page "Smart Factory on ERPNext – Weekly Implementation Plan" is the source of truth for task checkboxes; `PLAN.md` mirrors it. Both get checked off together the moment a task step is actually completed — not before.
- **2026-09-12 — GitHub populated, MIT license dropped, `smart_factory` deferred:** Pushed the actual monorepo content to `Niroshan-git/ERP-System` for the first time (previously created but empty apart from an auto-added LICENSE). Removed that MIT LICENSE since it doesn't fit a product meant to be sold/whitelabeled, not open-sourced. Started rebranding ERPNext Desk per `DESIGN.md` §6, but explicitly decided to do every settings-only change first (Website Settings, Navbar Settings, Dashboard Chart colors) and hold off creating the `smart_factory` app until that's done and asked for directly — the app is real infrastructure (bench app, install, hooks) and shouldn't be created as a side effect of a theming request.
- **2026-09-12 — Sidebar "ERPNext" label confirmed to need `smart_factory`, still deferred:** Traced the sidebar app-switcher "ERPNext" text to `erpnext/hooks.py` app metadata (not a settings field). Asked directly whether to create `smart_factory` now to fix it via a `boot_session` hook — user chose to keep deferring, opting instead for the smaller data-only fix of renaming the `Administrator` user's display name to "Ceylon Stack". The sidebar app-switcher label remains the one confirmed item that needs the app; everything else so far has been settings-only.
- **2026-09-12 — `smart_factory` created, full Desk branding pass done:** After the same "ERPNext" sidebar text was raised a third time, asked one more time for explicit confirmation scoped narrowly to this fix — user approved. Created and installed `smart_factory`, wired `boot_session` + `app_include_css` + `app_include_js` hooks covering navbar, sidebar, app-switcher, and button/link colors. Discovered and fixed two real infrastructure gotchas along the way (frontend/backend container filesystem split for static assets; running gunicorn workers not picking up a live `pip install -e`) — both documented above since they'll bite again on the next custom-app change unless the manual steps are repeated or a proper custom image build replaces the quick-start compose setup.
