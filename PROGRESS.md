# PROGRESS.md — Smart Factory on ERPNext

Chronological record of what's actually been done. Update this as work progresses rather than relying on chat history.

## Architecture & Planning Decisions

- Evaluated free/open-source ERP options broadly; chose **ERPNext** (built on the Frappe framework) as the ERP core — GPL-3.0 licensed, no paywalled modules unlike Odoo Community Edition.
- Confirmed ERPNext/Frappe's license terms: GPL-3.0 allows commercial use, whitelabeling, and selling implementation/hosting services, but forbids relicensing the core as closed-source, and requires source availability to anyone the software is distributed to.
- Decided on the **headless architecture**: unmodified ERPNext/Frappe core + separate custom Frappe app (`smart_factory`) for business logic + independent frontend (Next.js/Vercel) talking only through the REST API. This keeps the proprietary layer (frontend + custom app + MES/IoT service) legally separate from the GPL core.
- Mapped out the full Smart Factory layered architecture: Shop floor/IoT → Integration & MES → ERPNext core → Analytics & digital twin.
- Wrote the full 12-week implementation plan (see `PLAN.md`), tracked in a Notion page titled "Smart Factory on ERPNext – Weekly Implementation Plan".

## Infrastructure — Hosting Attempts

- **Oracle Cloud (abandoned):** Created an Oracle Cloud Always Free account, home region ended up as Singapore (the originally intended region wasn't available at signup). Attempted to provision a `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` instance (2 OCPU / 12GB RAM — Oracle's current Always Free ARM allocation after a June 2026 reduction from the older 4 OCPU/24GB). Hit repeated "out of host capacity" errors across multiple retry attempts. Since the account's region only has a single Availability Domain (AD-1), there was no AD to switch to as a workaround. Decision made to stop retrying and move to a paid host instead.
- **Hetzner Cloud (current):** Created a Hetzner account. Provisioned a **CX23** server (2 vCPU / 4GB RAM / 40GB SSD, Regular Performance tier, x86, Ubuntu 26.04) in **Helsinki** — roughly €4.50–7/month depending on final config. Provisioned successfully on the first real attempt, no capacity issues. Server name: `ubuntu-4gb-hel1-4`. Public IP: `62.238.22.161`.

## Server Setup

- Generated an SSH key pair locally (Windows, `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`), added the public key to Hetzner during server creation.
- Confirmed SSH access works: `ssh -i <key path> root@62.238.22.161`.
- Ran `apt update && apt upgrade -y` — patched the OS, including a kernel upgrade (7.0.0-30 → 7.0.0-31-generic), followed by a reboot to load the new kernel.
- Installed Docker: `apt install docker.io docker-compose-v2 -y` — completed cleanly.

## ERPNext Deployment

- Cloned `frappe/frappe_docker` from GitHub.
- Deployed using the `pwd.yml` quick-start compose file: `docker compose -f pwd.yml up -d`. All 11 images pulled successfully, all 16 containers (db, redis-cache, redis-queue, backend, frontend, websocket, scheduler, queue-short, queue-long, create-site, configurator) started without errors.
- Confirmed the `create-site` container completed successfully — Frappe and ERPNext both installed, DocTypes updated to 100%, site set to `frontend`.
- Logged into ERPNext at `http://62.238.22.161:8080` with Administrator / the `pwd.yml` default password (`admin`) — **this default password still needs to be changed before any real client data touches this instance.**
- Completed the initial company setup wizard (placeholder company details for the pilot environment).

## Version Control

- Created a GitHub repository for the project's custom app code: **https://github.com/Niroshan-git/ERP-System.git**
- Discussed (not yet executed) the workflow for editing code: VS Code's Remote-SSH extension to connect to the Hetzner server, then the Dev Containers extension's "Attach to Running Container" to edit files live inside the `frappe_docker-backend-1` container, with regular `git commit`/`git push` to the GitHub repo above since the container's filesystem is otherwise disposable.

## Not Yet Done (see PLAN.md for full context)

- The `smart_factory` custom Frappe app has not been created yet (`bench new-app smart_factory` — still pending).
- No manufacturing master data (Items, BOM, Workstations, Work Orders) has been created yet.
- No mobile browser testing of the Desk UI has been done yet.
- ERPNext Administrator default password has not been changed yet.
- MQTT broker, MES/FastAPI service, Postgres/TimescaleDB, and the Next.js frontend have not been started.

## Decision Log

- **2026-09-12 — Committed to active build, target client/marketing push next month (Oct 2026):** Reviewed `ACCESS.md` (server/repo/command reference) — confirmed accurate, no real secrets stored in it. Rebranded the product as **Ceylon Stack** (brand identity, palette, and typography documented in `docs/brand.md`). Scaffolded the monorepo structure (`apps/smart_factory`, `apps/mcp-server`, `apps/mes-service`, `apps/frontend`, `infra/`, `docs/`) ahead of actually building each service. Repo will move to a separate GitHub account (not yet finalized) before the current `Niroshan-git/ERP-System` remote is treated as permanent.
- **Task tracking going forward:** the Notion page "Smart Factory on ERPNext – Weekly Implementation Plan" is the source of truth for task checkboxes; `PLAN.md` mirrors it. Both get checked off together the moment a task step is actually completed — not before.
